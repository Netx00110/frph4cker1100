            <p>hello friends my name is Patrick</p>
            <p>The reason why ihave wrote this script is beacuse iwant to tell people and many young men outside here that everything is possible and i want to tell them that whatever they are doing let them not stop dont quit whatever you are doing am telling you who is reading this am sorry to tell you but dont quit</p>
            <p>in my primary school i went to visit my sister and she wasd  having a computer which was not being used by anybody so by then i started to use it becuase she was having a bar and i heard the simple basics of using computer that i heard copied from other people i studied how to use  virtual dj i started practicing it and i heard to be playing music in that bar and by then iwas like 12  4 i satrted getting knowledge on how to use a computer i learnt some more basics again 7 but then time reacvhed so i heard to go back to school then i left her with the computer and i came back to school and ayear later i had passed my exams asked her to send me the computer at home cause she was leaving very far from our home</p>
            <p>and ofcouse she had to send it to me bcause there was no one who was using it at her home so sent it to me 54 and by then i had to try everything so that i learn computer on my own thats when i went on youtube and open every youtube video talking about computer thats when i saw the video talking about how websites,software and apps are developed  so i had to watch some of the videos but i was not getting anything it i said no let me learn who develope a software cause thats what i liked the most from i had to download the youtube video but i said how am i going to  get money to buy data so that i download youtube course i said no i have to look for money so i had to go at the constraction site and look for money the first day i went to the constraction site i was not accepted because i was still young and another day i ahd to look for another place to work on it was a chance i got the job somewhere i worked the salary was 7000ugandan shillings idint have to lunch because i knew what i wanted  i had to download the youtube course then i went home i loaded 4000ugandan shillings on a simcard it was at night because every night 12:00am they would give 2Gigabytes for only 2000 so i bought the one for 4000 which was for 5Giga bytes because there was a bonus if you would buy the one for 5000 and then i downloaded the course, after downloading the course i heard to learn how to code the course was all about html so i had to practice it amonth later i started t be lazy as it was not earning something at all instead iwas the one putting money in it so istarted to watch some youtube videos showning how to make money online i created a youtube channel i started to upload videos showing how vpn can give free data on some phones but unfortunately the youtube channel did not grow so first so i had to leave it  look for another to start earniing thats when i found videos showing how to reset phone passwords and bypassing factory reset protection <span>(FRP)</span> which made me super genius about phones</p>
